San Fancisco - Submission


Working on getting the other files uploaded. Still learning how to use the github extension on VS Code. Apparently the folder containing the jupyter notebook explaining how I got to the submission is located in the .vscode folder to check out the jupyter notebook.

Link to the Jupyter Notebook containing the python coding and explainaitons.
